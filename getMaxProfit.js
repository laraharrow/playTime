/*
Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit 
I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

  var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

	getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);

=> returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step 
(at least 1 minute must pass).

const stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

// brute force solution
const getMaxProfit = function(stock) {
  let maxProfit = 0;
  // go though every price and time
  for (let earlierTime = 0; earlierTime < stock.length; earlierTime++) {
    let earlierPrice = stock[earlierTime];

    //go though all the LATER prices
    for (let laterTime = earlierTime + 1; laterTime < stock.length; laterTime++) {
      let laterPrice = stock[laterTime]

      // check all the potential profit
      let potentialProfit = laterPrice - earlierPrice;

      // update maxProfit with the higher value
      maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, potentialProfit);
    }
  }   
  return maxProfit;
} 

getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
